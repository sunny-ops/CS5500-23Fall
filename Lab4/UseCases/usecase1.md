# Use Case 1

<hr>
**Use Case**:  Set Canvas Dimensions

**Primary Actor**: System

**Goal in Context**: To initialize and present the mini-paint application canvas with a specific dimension of 600 pixels in width and 400 pixels in height

**Preconditions**: The mini-paint application is being launched or reset

**Trigger**: Application start or canvas reset event

**Scenario**: 

1. The system initializes the mini-paint application.
2. During initialization, the system sets the drawable canvas dimensions to 600 pixels wide and 400 pixels high.
3. The application window adjusts to fit the canvas size while accommodating any additional UI elements.

**Exceptions**: If there's a screen resolution constraint that does not permit a 600x400 window, the application should adjust accordingly

**Priority**: High

**When available**: First Release

**Channel to actor**: GUI

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**:  N/A

**Open Issues**:  Is there a need to allow users to adjust or resize the canvas in future iterations?

------

This use case provides a structured description of how the canvas dimensions are set in the mini-paint application.
