**Preconditions**: The mini-paint application is open, the canvas has some drawings or is filled with a color

4. The canvas is updated and displayed to the user in the new solid color.

**Exceptions**: If no color has been previously selected, the canvas might revert to a default color (e.g., white) or the system could notify the user to select a color first.
